# Company Q&A Chatbot  

Final project for the Building AI course  

## Summary  

This project is an AI-powered Q&A chatbot designed to help employees quickly find answers to questions about company policies, HR processes, and IT issues. The chatbot provides suggestions based on company guidelines and internal files, making information access faster and easier.  

## Background  

Employees often struggle to find the right information across multiple sources, such as HR manuals, IT FAQs, or policy documents. This can cause delays, reduce productivity, and increase repeated queries to HR or IT teams.  

This chatbot helps by:  
* Centralizing company knowledge into one easy-to-use tool  
* Providing instant answers, reducing wait time for HR/IT responses  
* Supporting employees across regions and time zones  

The motivation is to improve employee experience, streamline internal communication, and reduce the workload of HR and IT support teams.  

## How is it used?  

1. Employees access the chatbot via web or company intranet.  
2. They type in a question (e.g., *“How many annual leave days do I have?”* or *“How do I reset my email password?”*).  
3. The chatbot searches company guidelines, HR documents, and IT policies.  
4. It provides a clear, AI-generated answer or directs the user to the correct resource.  

**Example use cases:**  
* HR: Leave policies, benefits, payroll cut-off dates  
* IT: Password resets, software access, troubleshooting guides  
* General: Compliance rules, office policies, onboarding info

## Data sources and AI methods  

The chatbot is powered by:  
* **Data sources**: Internal company policies, HR manuals, IT support FAQs, compliance guidelines  
* **AI methods**:  
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand employee questions  
  - Information retrieval and semantic search to find relevant answers  
  - Context-based response generation to align with company policy  

## Challenges  

* **Accuracy**: AI responses must align strictly with official company policies to avoid misinformation.  
* **Confidentiality**: Sensitive employee or company data should not be exposed.  
* **Maintenance**: Policies and guidelines frequently change, requiring regular updates to the data sources.  
* **Limitations**: The chatbot cannot replace human HR or IT judgment in complex or exceptional cases.  

## What next?  

Future improvements may include:  
* Multi-language support for global employees  
* Integration with HRIS and IT service management systems  
* Voice-enabled interaction  
* Analytics to track common employee questions and improve policy communication
